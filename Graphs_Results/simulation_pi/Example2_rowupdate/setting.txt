-Example is Courtois from Joost Berkhout's code
-Update is done for entire theta row
-Epsilon is initially chosen fixed at 0.1 and N=3000
 -> Used many 'boosts' check desktop graph
-There is no (special) stopping condition, the algorithm stops after N iterations


Note:

Idea: Show progress of max in every 5-10 iterations
