A problem we encounter for the fix epsilon case of our algorithm is the following: We see that 
our objective function is increasing in every step of the algorithm until step n. After step 
n our objective function keeps decreasing for a m sequential steps until it get stuck 
on a final objective value, after the algorithm gets stuck, it start alternating between 2 
theta coordinates with the same derivative but only a sign difference. 

We give an explenation for the phenomenon using a 3 dimensional example. 

Suppose we have an optimum localtion Theta* with a non-symmetric neighbourhood w.r.t. to 
te derivatives. So it can be that if we take a level set K(x)={ theta | J(theta)=x}, then we 
that J'(theta_1) does not need to equal J'(theta_2) for theta_1, theta_2 in K(x). 

Let our decreasing sequence of theta's be (theta_1, theta_2, theta_3,... theta_n) at the end of our 
alogorithm. Our first decreasing step occurs because near the optimum our gradient became to large '
in terms of the norm and it jumps over the optimum into a steeper region of the neigbourhood
(steeper wrt the gradient) and our objective value decreases, because our epsilon is fixed and we now have steeper derivative 
in the next update, our algorithm jumps even further over the optimum and our objective value 
decreases again. This process keeps repeating itself until gets to a point where it finds 2 points 
with the same derivative and keeps jumping between those points.
