-Example is P[i,j]=1/n for all i,j
-Update is done for entire theta row
-Epsilon is chosen initially fixed at 0.005 and N=2000
-> Epsilon for r=0,3,5 gets tho following 'boosts': at 150 divide by 5, at 500 divide by 
-> 10, from 1000 onwards let epsilon be decreasing with 1/(10*n).
-> for r=7 this did not work, (NOTE: this choice was based on best choice for r=5) and we -> used the following 'boosts': at 500 divide by 5, at 700 divide by 5, 900 onwards 1/10*n
-There is no (special) stopping condition, the algorithm stops after N iterations


NOTE: using decreasing from the start doesn't seem to work, but some different (simpler) kind of mix could be made that works well for all r. Where we need some initial larger epsilon and then apply decreasing, this will most likely require >2000 iterations.
