-Example is P[i,j]=1/n for all i,j
-Update is done for a single theta element
-Epsilon is chosen fixed at 0.1 and N=500
-There is no (special) stopping condition, the algorithm stops after N iterations

Note: 
increasing epislon will quicken the process up to a point were it no longer converges, decreasing epsilon (1/iter) is much slower, a combi could work better.
